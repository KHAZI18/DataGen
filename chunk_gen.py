AIROBRAIN AIROBRAIN ACHIVED AIROBRAIN Home About Open Source projects collaboration free services AN AI PROGRAM THAT PREDICTS SEQUENCE THE NEXT NUMBER ! This smart program predicts the next number in the given SEQUENCE 
                            This program predicts next number in given sequence Don't know what exactly i should call is but this program gonna understand the sequence by learning from the given set of numbers
For eg : if 1,2,3 so its an easy sequence the next number is obviously going to be 4 even a kid can answer it But when thing become complex like 1,2,5,6,9,10,? Whats next number is going to be by taking some time and calculation a human can also answer it but this program is gonna be supper fast in that and answer in MS But things are going to be more complex ,next number is 13

43,32,23,15,8,? Sequence became more complex so it requires some better iq to be fast and calculate for humans but this program can just ...... . . . But things became more complex it was difficult for me too to decode

As to teach somebudddy teacher should be able to solve üòÖ thats y my program also unable to solve some problems

Like 15,29,56,108,208....expected answer is 400 behind this there is some complex logic i have decoded this answer but dont know how to teach this im searching for algorithms to teach my program AN SINMPLE WINDOWS APPLICATION WHERE IS THE MOUSE ? This is an windows CMD based application written in python and build into .exe file This program find the exact location of the pointer and returns the in the form of x & y coordinates. QRcode-generator for terminal can create an QRCODE ! This is an terminal based python oriented qrcode generator specially made for mobile users
                            this program can create an QR code for an any given text that too without an GUI this python program can run on your mobile device and allows you to save an copy of it learn more by clicking on this link . Email:airobrain@gmail.com Copyright ¬©Ô∏è AIROBRAIN 2023
